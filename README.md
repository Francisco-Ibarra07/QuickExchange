# QuickExchange (Site is currently a work in progress)
Use QuickExchange as your middleman to swap pictures, URL links, videos, or files between any mobile or desktop platform.

## Motivation
Have you ever had a friend who has sent you a URL link, photo, or PDF file to your phone and you wish to open this content on your laptop or on another device? If you have Apple related products, the AirDrop feature would get the job done of transfering the content from your phone to your laptop. But if you are like me who owns an iPhone and uses Windows PC, AirDrop isn't an option. 

Introducing QuickExchange, a fast, reliable, and secure way of transfering files or URL links from one device to another. QuickExchange is entirely web-based, no need to download any sort of application on your laptop or mobile device. Simply create a [free account](https://quickexchange.pythonanywhere.com/register) and you can then begin to use the app! 

## How it works
When you login with your new account, you are given a what we call a **Stack**. Let's say that you want to transfer a file over from your phone to your laptop. Simply login to QuickExchange from your phone and **push** your file onto your personal **Stack**. Then from your laptop, or any other device, go onto the same QuickExchange app and **pop** your file out so you can view/download it. You can repeat this process to exchange any <a href="https://quickexchange.pythonanywhere.com/about" target="_blank">file types</a> between any sort of device.

Better yet, we created a Google Chrome extension that you can use! You can now have access to your Stack at any point in your browsing experience.
