All extensions need a manifest.json

Content scripts is a javascript that runs as soon as a website loads
- Allows us to interact with user's content screen
(like adblock getting called once website is loaded)
Example for manifest file:
"content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "<all_urls>"
      ],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]


Background scripts
- It loads when u launch chrome 
- Listens to chrome actions
- Doesn't log to standard inspect tool. Logs somewhere else
  - Under "Inspect views" button in extensions list
Example code:
"background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"]
  }

Browser action
- Can set up and icon and an image
- By clicking the button, it activates a "browser action" call
- Let background script to LISTEN for this browser action
- Can load a popup html files from here
"browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "favicon/favicon-16x16.png",
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_title": "A popup will come here"
  }

Popups
- Can be called to open on a browser action
